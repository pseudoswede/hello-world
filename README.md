# hello-world
A greeting to the world.
I think the world is grand, and people are beautiful. If only we could all see our place in the tempest, where we would be most useful. Not fighting the winds, or riding aimlessly, but coursing through, wings outstretched, with good purpose. I think most simply do not understand the scope of their own existence, and how we all affect the storm.
